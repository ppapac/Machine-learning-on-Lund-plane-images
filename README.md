# Machine-learning-on-Lund-plane-images
This is a snippet of code used for my Seminar on reasearch in physics course during 5th year.

lund primary.ipynb - constructs and plots primary lund plane density from npy jets file

modelhistogram - trains a CNN using lund plane density images

lund primary,secondary,tertiary_hist - constructs multiple channels corresponding to secondary, tertiary etc. lund plane and trains a network for n=3

modelhistogram-strojno - trains simple network using lund coordinates
